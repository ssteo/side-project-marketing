# The Side Project Marketing Checklist

[![](https://i.imgur.com/uZJHDXL.jpg)](https://www.sideprojectchecklist.com/marketing-checklist)


## What

The [Side Project Marketing Checklist](https://www.sideprojectchecklist.com/marketing-checklist) is a comprehensive, chronologically ordered list of marketing tactics and ideas that you can try with your next side project. The list is free and open source.


## Why

I've been building little software side projects for years, but I've always been terrible at marketing them. I come up with some ideas, forget those ideas, do some random stuff, then lose interest. The goal of this repository is to fix that.


## Quickstart

1. Copy the [marketing-checklist.md](marketing-checklist.md) file or [fork this repository](https://github.com/karllhughes/side-project-marketing).

2. Add, remove, or modify the tactics as you see fit based on your project and customers.

3. Get to work! The checklist format allows you to keep up with which things you've tried and which you haven't.

4. Profit? I mean, that's the goal, right?

The checklist and companion blog posts are also available online at [sideprojectchecklist.com](https://www.sideprojectchecklist.com/).

Don't forget to also check out the [Side Project Sales Checklist](https://github.com/karllhughes/side-project-sales) as well.
